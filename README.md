# Description 
Welcome to my DevSecOps project where I deploy a Netflix clone application using modern DevOps practices and tools. In this project, I leverage Jenkins for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD), Docker for containerization, and integrating different tools with each other, Kubernetes for orchestration, and monitoring tools like Grafana, Prometheus, and Node Exporter for observability.
